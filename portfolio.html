    <div><h4>Grocery List</h4><p>My second project. I applied my knowledge of html and discovered styling with css! I enjoyed this project the most because I got to lay basic html code for the foundation then added css to pull the over look at of the website together!</p></div>
    <div><h4>The Vault</h4><p>Lastly my project that was the hardest, implication of javascript. I have a lot to learn with the java language. But with each project my skills become more developed and my understanding started</p></div>
